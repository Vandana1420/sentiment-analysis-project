Sentiment Analysis using BERT
This project implements a Sentiment Analysis model using BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) to classify the sentiment of text data as positive, negative, or neutral.
It leverages Python, PyTorch, and Transformers (HuggingFace) â€” providing a strong foundation for understanding how modern AI models are fine-tuned for Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks.


Project Overview

Used pre-trained BERT model for text classification
Fine-tuned the model on a labeled dataset to predict sentiment
Evaluated model accuracy and generated predictions on unseen text
Implemented using Python, PyTorch, scikit-learn, and HuggingFace Transformers

Key Skills Demonstrated

Natural Language Processing (NLP)
Large Language Model (LLM) fine-tuning concepts
Data preprocessing and tokenization
Model training, evaluation, and optimization
Exposure to state-of-the-art transformer architectures
